dev:
 * support for xml schema files that import from another schema file
   - schema files are written to local data subdirectory
   - schemaLocation paths in registered schema files get changed accordingly
   - additional schema files that are not validated against directly but
     imported from another schema file should get additional characters in
     their type name field (e.g. "XMLSchema_nested" for an XMLSchema file)
 * support for default namespace in xpath lookups
